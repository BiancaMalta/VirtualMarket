# VirtualMarket
### ► What this article is about
This article aims to develop a virtual market. The application shows the user a menu that makes it possible to register new items, list those already registered, and purchase them. To avoid the insertion of repetitions, there is a control of the products. The user has access to view their shopping cart and when the procedure is complete, their data is deleted.
